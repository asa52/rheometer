DC_func: a constant input function to be fed into DAC1, set at the mid-value 2047. 

NR: Mode of normalised resonance. 1 for normalised resonance on.

korb = 0, 

simu_k: Simulated k, such that simu_k/simu_k_unit is equal to tau_c in eqn 3.11.
simu_k_unit: Normalisation of simu_k, 128, such that simu_k/simu_k_unit = tau_c in eqn 3.11.
