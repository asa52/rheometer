# Test how noise level and frequency affects the measuring functions'
# accuracy and error. Perhaps modifying these apparatus by adding filtering.
# Used The Art of Electronics to test against different types of noise. We
# are testing here that the introduction of noise to a perfect signal does
# not significantly shift the measured functions' output - it should increase
# their error, but nothing more. Any systematic shifts in the amplitude,
# phase, and frequency measurements suggest that it is the measurement of the
# signal, rather than the signal (eventually from the ODE integrator) itself
# that is being affected. So for example, for 50Hz noise, for the amplitude
# measurement we may get 4 peaks - 2 due to the main signals, which are split
# into two more due to an overlap 50Hz sine. The true amplitude is in this
# case the midpoint of the 50Hz signal, so filtering this out would improve
# the accuracy of that measurement. Filtering is NOT applied to signals being
# fed back into the ODE integrator (it does not make sense to FFT some very
# noise signals).
